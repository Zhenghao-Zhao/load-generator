## Instructions for using riemann on Windows

### Steps:
1. Download the standalone from here:
https://github.com/riemann/riemann/releases/download/0.3.5/riemann-0.3.5-standalone.jar <br />
Make sure it is placed in the same folder as riemann.config

2. Run riemann server by typing in command line (windows):
java -jar riemann-0.3.5-standalone.jar

3. Run client code (send requests to riemann server)

### Files:
1. riemann.config file contains the configuration for the server. This is also where I put Jordan's riemannMock.clj code.
3. riemann.log... file is a log file auto-generated by the server.
