## Instructions for using riemann

### Steps:
1. Download the standalone from here:
https://github.com/riemann/riemann/releases/download/0.3.5/riemann-0.3.5-standalone.jar
Make sure it is placed at the same level as riemann.config.

2. spin up riemann server by typing in command line (windows):
java -jar riemann-0.3.5-standalone.jar.

3. run client code (sending http requests to riemann server):
python client.py

### Files:
1. riemann.config file contains the configuration for the server. This is also where I put Jordan's riemannMock.clj code.
3. riemann.log... file is a log file auto-generated by the server.
4. riemann-0.3.5-standalone.jar is the riemann server code. We do not need to modify anything here.
