# Instaload
A collaboration project between [Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com/) and the [ANU TechLauncher initiative](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/).

## About
Instaload is an application which can emulate metrics data generated from a large number of Instaclustr user database nodes. This mock data can then be used to performance test Instaclustr's internal cloud monitoring system.

Instaload will allow Instaclustr developers to generate large amounts of mock data with minimal cost and manual labor. Allowing much faster and easier performance testing of their monitoring system.
