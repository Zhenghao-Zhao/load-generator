# Instaload
A collaboration project between [Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com/) and the [ANU TechLauncher initiative](https://cs.anu.edu.au/TechLauncher/).

## About
Instaload is an application which can emulate metrics data generated from a large number of Instaclustr user database nodes. This mock data can then be used to performance test Instaclustr's internal cloud monitoring system.

Instaload will allow Instaclustr developers to generate large amounts of mock data with minimal cost and manual labor. Allowing much faster and easier performance testing of their monitoring system.

## Installation

### Instaload 
Language: **Python 3.7**

For Google's Snappy library and its Python binding:
1. For *nix users (including MacOS users):
    1. Install Snappy C libs, following instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20678150/9479242)
    <br>*Note: you might also be required to install gcc libraries that those instructions were based on, possibly refer to
    [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11912878/gcc-error-gcc-error-trying-to-exec-cc1-execvp-no-such-file-or-directory)*
    2. Install the Python binding following [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41707800/9479242)
2. For Windows users:
    * Follow instructions in [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43756412/9479242)
    
For other libraries: 
* Install libraries from requirements.txt (instaload\requirements.txt)

### Monitoring app
Language: **Java 14**
* We use Maven for managing libraries and dependencies for this application
<br>Find the pom.xml file via mock_services\moni_app\pom.xml

### RabbitMQ
* Download the RabbitMQ server for your system [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)

### Riemann
1. For *nix users (including MacOS), simply follow the instructions [here](http://riemann.io/quickstart.html)
2. For Windows users, the easiest way is to download the standalone .jar file from their [git releases](https://github.com/riemann/riemann/releases) 


## Configuration
You are allowed to supply additional configuration files:

1. To configure our [RabbitMQ client](https://pika.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/parameters.html) 's initial settings, you can [specify its file path at cmd](#running-the-application) to run the application or modify the existing rabbitmq_config.json file.
Currently only the parameters specified in rabbitmq_config.json can be user-provided. 

2. The load generated by Instaload can also be configured. We've provided a sample load configuration file at **data\configs\examples\load_config.json**.
    - load_config.json describes a sample structure for the configuration file: a list of Cluster objects with properties of id, schema, table, metrics and nodes. 
        - **id**: a unique identifier number for that cluster. 
        - **schema and table numbers**: they make up the service name for all of the metrics in that cluster. For example a schema number 2 with a table number 2 will generate 2 * 2 many metric names with the same metric values. They will be distributed to the respective database according to the schema and table numbers.
        - **metrics**: contains the metric names and their value ranges that the nodes under that cluster commonly have. 
        - **nodes**: a list of node objects with its unique id and additional metrics.
    - You may specify as many clusters and nodes as you want in the json file as long as you follow the provided format. The application will generate the load exactly as specified in the file when it's running. 
    
## Running the application
1. Make sure both RabbitMQ and Riemann servers are running
2. Run the application from **main.py** (instaload\main.py) (e.g. *python main.py*)
3. Optional: specify config file paths in commandline: **--input_rmq_config**, **--input_load_config** (e.g. *python main.py --input_rmq_config path1 --input_load_config path2*)
    * **--input_rmq_config** is the path to the .json file that configures the connection from the rabbitmq client used by Instaload to your destined rabbitMQ server. By default it uses **data\configs\examples\rabbitmq_config.json**.
    * **--input_load_config** is the path to the .json file that describes the format of the load you want to generate. By default it uses **data\configs\examples\load_config.json**.
